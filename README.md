### Introduction
Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. In 1991,Guido Van Rossum created Python, and the Python Software Foundation (PSF) further contributed to its development. Python was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Developers can use Python to integrate systems efficiently. There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3.
